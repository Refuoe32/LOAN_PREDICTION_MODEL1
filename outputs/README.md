# Loan Prediction System

 ## Project Overview
 This project develops a machine learning model to predict loan approval outcomes for Motz Financial Services. The model uses applicant data such as gender, marital status, income, and credit history to determine loan eligibility. A key focus is identifying the most important features influencing loan approval. Preprocessed training and testing datasets are saved for inspection.

 ## Dataset
 The dataset (`loan_data_set.csv`) contains applicant details and loan status. Key features include:
 - ApplicantIncome
 - CoapplicantIncome
 - LoanAmount
 - Credit_History
 - Loan_Status (target)

 ## Methodology
 1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values using mode for categorical and median for numerical features; removed outliers with IQR method.
 2. **Preprocessing**: Created Total_Income feature, encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features.
 3. **Data Splitting**: Randomly split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
 4. **Model**: Used XGBoost for its robustness and feature importance capabilities.
 5. **Tuning**: Applied GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters.
 6. **Feature Importance**: Analyzed and ranked features to identify those most critical for loan approval.
 7. **Dashboard**: Built a Streamlit-based dashboard with interactive visualizations and feature importance insights.
